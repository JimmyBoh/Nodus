Lightweight, Browser-based, Grid Computing platform for Node.js

This module simplifies the implementation of a Grid Architecture for computations. Grid computing allows for client browsers to run calculations and send the result back to your server. This module makes it easy to create a server that will manage data, requests, and queueing.

While Javascript does not have the highest performance, the sheer number of devices that natively run it in the browser is overwhelming.  If we can harness the javascript power on every device, the computational power would be astronomical.

What's it taste like?
=====================
 - Rendering Farms and Image Processing
 - Collatz Conjecture and other Mathematical Theories
 - Statistical Simulations and other Experiments
 - Anything you can program! (Hopefully for the betterment of humanity!)

 

 
What's in it?
==================
 1. Grid Server
  - Handles the client work requests
  - Serves client scripts and basic status page
 2. That's IT!
 
Once your server is running, add `<script type="text/javascript" src="HOST:PORT/client.js"/>` and it will handle the rest!
